This is the final version of the summer project that I have been working on to finish a game, and learn more things with Unity 5 and Game Development

Title: Survive The Night TDS

This Project is an Top Down Shooter with a Money System, clean in-game shop UI, and an Animated Menu Screen. In this game, the player earns cash by defeating waves of enemies and must earn enough money to purchase their escape.

Release version 1.0.0 is finished and playable: https://gpmeyers.itch.io/survive-the-night-tds
